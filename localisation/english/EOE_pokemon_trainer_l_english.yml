 START_SCREEN_EOE_trainer:0 "Our starship has been drifting in the universe for too long, and the history of the parent planet is almost an ancient legend for us; We can only remember that generations of ancestors passed through countless barren stellar systems in order to find a new home. Finally, in this galaxy, we found a planet with lush vegetation and rich resources. This planet is full of strange creatures with extraordinary power, but they are not difficult to deal with and easy to tame. We call it Pokemon. With the power of Pokemon, our civilization has expanded rapidly on the planet. In just a few decades, we have established a unified country that spans the whole planet and restored technologies that we have forgotten for a long time. Today, we are ready to launch a journey to the sea of stars!"


 START_SCREEN_EOE_trainer_eevee:0"At first, we were created by an advanced civilization as pets or toys. After the creators suddenly left for unknown reasons, our ancestors lived their lives as gregarious predators. The combination of different types makes us top predators in any environment, over millions of years of evolution, our vocalizations have become more and more complex, our tribes have grown larger and larger... Finally, oneday, maybe a primitive Eeveelution accidentally learned to use psionic power to operate a advanced weapon left by creators... All of a sudden, everything went faster.\n\tThe teaching of tool use skills, the formation of language and writing, the development of productive forces, the emergence of surplus wealth... The threshold of technology explosion has been broken, the power of wisdom and civilization has taken over the baton from natural selection. Ten thousand years passed in a flash, We tamed the heritage of the pioneers and used the magic devices called pokeball in the ancient relics to control the psionic creatures that had fought with us and let them work for us. The cities of creators, silenced for million years, were once again ablaze with lights. But this time, pets became owners.\n     Later, with the in-depth understanding of the relics of the pioneers, we restarted a large number of ancient automatic factories, let us live like a fairy tale.  In the carefree lives, our population grew exponentially. Finally, relying on those nourishment centers and affluence centers, we supported the early space age population at the technical level of the bronze age. But those factories without maintenance must have a day to shut down... \n   When those factories that are regarded as natural laws  produces less and less package foods, we had a brief panic. But we soon found that the psionic creatures called Pokemon around us are natural production tools. Almost every Pokemon capability can be used in certain aspects of production, and they can strictly follow the instructions of the trainer. In the face of impending hunger and death, we quickly picked up the Pokemon domestication technology that had been ignored and rebuilt the production system before the collapse of social order. \nAnyway, the fairy tale era is over. The era of equality and enjoyment for all has become the dust of history with the collapse of the ancient factory. We started working again, oppressing and exploiting again, fighting against each other again...Day after day passed by, we learned the secrets of the atom, understood the origin of life, but we can't explain we Pokemon's magic ability. We went out of the atmosphere carefully, but found ourselves not alone in the starry sky. An ancient mechanical fleet stared at the planet silently, but was indifferent to all our actions. Everything is so smooth, as if there is a god of creation guiding us forward...\n About 30 years ago, one mining group discovered an alien ship destroyed by gunfire in our system, and its hyperspace engine opened another door to physics for us. Now, with the improvement of subspace theory, The best minds in [Getname] have completed the development of the first generation of hyperspace engines. We finally got rid of the shackles of the speed of light and were ready to reveal the mysteries of our history among the stars..."
